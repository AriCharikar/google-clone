# google-clone
A google homepage clone made with HTML and SASS
Has media queries to resize to screen sizes as small as 320px and uses the Canadian version of google as a template. The conversion was made without looking at the google source code, and was made as an approximate design.
Design is of course by google, and belongs to google.
